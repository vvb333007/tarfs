/**
 * TARFS File API: tarf_open(), tarf_close(), tarf_read(),
 * tarf_pread(), tarf_lseek(), tarf_mmap(), tarf_munmap(),
 * tarf_dupfd(), tarf_stat(), tarf_fstat(), tarf_fcntl(), tarf_ioctl()
 *
 * tarf_dupfd() is similar to POSIX dup(), except that the duplicated file
 * descriptor does not share its file position with the original. Instead,
 * a completely independent copy of the file descriptor is created.
 *
 * How it works:
 * open() uses inode_lookup() to find the requested inode, allocates a file
 * descriptor structure, initializes it from the inode, and increments the
 * filesystem reference count.
 *
 * close() decrements the filesystem reference count.
 *
 * read() and pread() are implemented as simple memcpy() operations.
 *
 * Functions that operate on a file descriptor rely on the open()/close()
 * reference-counting protocol. The filesystem reference is acquired by
 * open() and released by close(), guaranteeing that the filesystem remains
 * valid for the lifetime of every open file descriptor.

 * do not open another file immediately :)
 *
 * This is because of:
 *
 * Closing a file descriptor while another thread is executing read()
 * (or any operation using the same descriptor) is undefined behaviour.
 *
 * Since file descriptor slots are immediately reusable, a concurrent
 * open() may repurpose the same slot for another file before the running
 * operation completes, causing it to access the newly opened file instead
 * of the original one.
