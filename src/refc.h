 *            function is called exactly once.
 *
 * @param dtor : destructor function. standart C function free() can be used here
 *              If `dtor` is NULL, object is not destroyed even when reference counter reaches zero, possibly creating a memory leak.

 *       If /object/ is NULL, reference counter pointer /r/ is passed
 *       to the destructor instead.

 *
 * @note It is safe to call unrefxn() with the same /n/ value that
 *       was previously passed to addrefn(), even if current reference
 *       count becomes smaller than /n/.
