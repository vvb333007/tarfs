/**
 * Map a file into the process address space.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 *
 * @code
 * int fd = open(...);
 * void *ptr = mmap(NULL, length, PROT_READ, flags, fd, offset);
 * close(fd);
 *
 * // use ptr
 * @endcode
 *
 * The mapping remains valid after the file descriptor has been closed.
 *
 * Since TARFS is a read-only filesystem, this implementation does not support
 * the PROT_WRITE protection flag. MAP_ANONYMOUS is also not supported:
 * mmap() is intended exclusively for mapping files.
 *
 * There is no limit on the number of active mappings. Every file in TARFS may
 * be mapped simultaneously, provided the underlying flash memory can hold it.
 * Mappings do not consume any runtime resources. In contrast, each open file
 * occupies one file descriptor until it is closed.
 *
 * @param addr Must be NULL. Fixed-address mappings are not supported.
 * @param length Number of bytes to map.
 * @param prot Memory protection flags. Only PROT_READ is supported.
 * @param flags Mapping flags. Use MAP_SHARED or MAP_PRIVATE. On a read-only
 *              filesystem both behave identically.
 * @param fd Open file descriptor to map.
 * @param offset File offset where the mapping begins.
 *
 * @return Pointer to the mapped file data, or MAP_FAILED on error.

/**
 * Remove a previously created memory mapping.
 *
 * Since mappings themselves do not allocate runtime resources, failing to call
 * munmap() does not lead to resource leaks. However, an active mapping keeps
 * the filesystem mounted, preventing it from being unmounted until the mapping
 * is removed.
 *
 * @param addr Address previously returned by mmap().
 * @param length Length of the mapped region.
 *
 * @return 0 on success, or -1 on error.

 *
 * Creates a directory stream from an existing directory file descriptor.
 * After a successful call, the file descriptor is owned by the returned
 * directory stream and must not be closed directly. It will be closed
 * automatically by tard_closedir().
 *
 * @param fd Directory file descriptor obtained by tarf_open() with
 *           O_DIRECTORY.
 *
 * @return
 *   A pointer to a directory stream on success, or NULL on failure with

/**
 * Create an independent duplicate of a file descriptor.
 *
 * This function is similar to POSIX dup(), but the file position is
 * not shared. The new descriptor has its own independent file offset,
 * initialized to the current position of the original descriptor.
 *
 * Both descriptors refer to the same file, but subsequent seek/read
 * operations affect their positions independently.
 *
 * Unlike POSIX dup(), this function does not use shared open file
 * description semantics. It is provided as a lightweight alternative
 * suitable for read-only TARFS files.
 *
 * @param fd
 *     File descriptor to duplicate.
 *
 * @return
 *     New file descriptor on success, or -1 on error.
